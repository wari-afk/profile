          <p> My name is Pierre. I've just completed a 9 weeks bootcamp at Le Wagon
          where I learned to become a programmer!
            <br> After 7+ years working in Marketing and Sales, I'm currently learning how to build great digital products @Le Wagon.

          <h2> Answering a few questions ... </h2>
              <strong>Can you give an introduction to yourself? </strong>
              <p>Pierre, 31, from France</p>
              <strong>Why did you want to learn to code?</strong>
              <p>I want to know how the apps and websites I use everyday are built</p>
              <strong> What are the best parts of the bootcamp so far? How far along in the bootcamp are you?</strong>
              <p> We're done now with Back-end related lectures and are starting to learn about Front-End. This is basically how you make a website look great!</p>
              <strong>What defines you and what makes you happy?</strong>
              <p> I'm a curious person, always eager to learn something new. After this bootcamp, I'd like to be able to give life to some of the product ideas I've had in the past</p>
